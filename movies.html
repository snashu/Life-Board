            <h3 class="instructions"> 1) The first thing you'll need to do is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=&site=&q=piratebay"> click here</a> and find a result that goes to the PB site. The site should look like this: </h3>

            <h3 class="instructions"> 3) Find your desired season/episode in the list. Sometimes you might have to download a whole season to get a particular episode if the show isn't super popular. But that's okay. Make sure you look at how many seeders there are currently under the "SE" column. Seeders represent how many people are hosting the file for downloading. If there are zero seeders, you will have to wait indefinitely for a person hosting the file to come online. <b> Once you've found your desired show, click on it, and a screen like this should populate: </b> </h3>

            <h3> Next click MAGNET, do not click anything else. Everything else is an ad! Your browser may ask if you want to open the file in uTorrent/bitTorrent. Click OK and any other prompts that ask permission. Once your Torrent reads "Seeding" or "Finished" your file has downloaded. Right click on the green bar and select "Open Containing Folder" and your movie/show will be in there. </h3>
